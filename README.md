# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project - Wrangle and Analyze WeRateDogs tweets.

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, the project gathers data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assesses its quality and tidiness, then provides a cleaned version. This process is known as data wrangling. These wrangling efforts are documents in a Jupyter Notebook and a separate write-up.

The dataset which will be wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
